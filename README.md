# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a given dataset in CSV format and apply different Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a customer of our company will churn or not. After training multiple models, we evaluate and compare their performance using various evaluation metrics.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- **Naive Bayes Model**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related information, which serves as input features for training the models. The target variable indicates whether the customer has churned.

## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the effectiveness of our models, we use the following evaluation metrics:
- **Confusion Matrix**: To analyze the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Classification Report**: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
- **AUC-ROC Curve**: To visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

## Results and Comparison
The performance of the models is compared based on the above evaluation metrics, allowing us to determine the most effective model for predicting customer churn.
